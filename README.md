### **Movie Recommender System ðŸŽ¬**

This project is a movie recommendation system built in Python that demonstrates two key machine learning approaches: **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering**. The app is hosted using Streamlit to provide an interactive user interface for exploring the models.

#### **Project Overview**

The goal of this project was to build a robust recommendation engine from scratch using the **MovieLens 100k dataset**. The project showcases a full data science workflow, from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model building, evaluation, and deployment.

The two main models implemented are:

  * **Content-Based Filtering:** This model recommends movies based on the similarity of their features (e.g., genres, title). It's great for new users or items, as it doesn't require prior interaction data.
  * **Collaborative Filtering:** This model recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users. It excels at discovering latent, unexpected patterns in user behavior, leading to serendipitous recommendations.

### **Key Features**

  * **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit allows for real-time model interaction.
  * **Dual-Model Approach:** The app demonstrates and compares two distinct recommendation strategies.
  * **Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics (RMSE, MAE) are used to evaluate the collaborative filtering model's prediction accuracy.

#### **Methodology**

1.  **Data Acquisition and Cleaning:** The MovieLens 100k dataset was loaded and preprocessed. Missing values and inconsistencies were handled, and the data was prepared for each model.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations were created to understand the distribution of ratings, popular movies, and genre prevalence.
3.  **Model Building:**
      * **Content-Based:** A TF-IDF vectorizer was used to convert movie content into numerical vectors. **Cosine similarity** was then calculated to find the most similar movies.
      * **Collaborative:** The **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** algorithm from the `surprise` library was trained on the user-item rating matrix.
4.  **Deployment:** The final application was containerized and hosted on the Streamlit Community Cloud for public access.

### **How to Run the App Locally**

To run this project on your machine, follow these steps:

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
cd Movie-Recommendation-System
```

**2. Create and activate a virtual environment:**

```bash
python -m venv rec_env
source rec_env/bin/activate
```

*(On Windows, use `.\rec_env\Scripts\activate`)*

**3. Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

  * **Troubleshooting:** If you encounter a NumPy 2.x compatibility error, please downgrade to a version 1.x using `pip install numpy==1.26.4` before installing other requirements. This issue is due to library dependencies that have not yet been updated for NumPy 2.x.

**4. Run the Streamlit app:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the app in your web browser.

### **Future Work**

  * **Hybrid Model:** The next step would be to build a hybrid model that intelligently combines the strengths of both content-based and collaborative filtering to improve recommendation quality.
  * **User Profiles:** Implement a feature to allow users to create and save profiles, and use their full viewing history to generate more personalized recommendations.
  * **Scalability:** Adapt the codebase to handle much larger datasets (e.g., using Spark or another distributed computing framework).
